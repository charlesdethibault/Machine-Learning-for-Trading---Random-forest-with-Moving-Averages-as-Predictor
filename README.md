# Machine-Learning-for-Trading---Random-forest-with-Moving-Averages-as-Predictor

In this paper, I have covered the application of Random forest prediction for trading.

The moving average simple 10 and 20 have been used for the paper.

From two moving average derives many different predicators, in this paper we will concentrated 
1. Moving averages crossover
2. Short moving average and price crossover
3. Long moving average and price crossover
4. Short Moving average slope
5. Long moving average slope

As we can see the model prediction has a 98% success rate on the training set and only 52% in the testing set. This suggests overfitting.
